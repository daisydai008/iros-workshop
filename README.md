# IROS 2025 Workshop - HOVER: Generalized Retargeting for Dexterous Manipulation

Interactive website for the "HOVER: Generalized Retargeting for Dexterous Manipulation" workshop presentation at IROS 2025.

## 📝 About

**HOVER** (Human-Operator Virtual-Enhanced Retargeting) introduces a novel approach to dexterous manipulation that bridges the embodiment gap between human demonstrations and robotic execution. By introducing a virtual operator that simulates human teleoperation adaptively, HOVER enables goal-directed behaviors that generalize across tasks while preserving human-like motion, with direct hardware deployment capability.

## 🎯 Key Contributions

- **Generalizable Retargeting Policy**: Single policy across diverse tasks achieving both high task fidelity and anthropomorphism—metrics that existing methods trade off
- **Virtual Operator Methodology**: Novel training paradigm simulating closed-loop human control for offline demonstrations, maintaining generalization through minimal interface design
- **Comprehensive Evaluation**: Improved success rates across diverse manipulation tasks in simulation and successful real hardware deployment with DexHand021

## 📊 Workshop Materials

- **Poster**: High-resolution poster available for download on the website
- **Demo Videos**: Interactive demonstrations showcasing HOVER's retargeting capabilities
- **Source Code**: Coming soon
- **DexCanvas Dataset**: Our self-collected human manipulation dataset (to be released)
